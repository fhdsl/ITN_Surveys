# ITN Follow-Up

The <a href="https://www.itcrtraining.org/" target="_blank">ITCR Training Network (ITN)</a> develops training materials (courses, videos, workshops, and more) for informatics and cancer research, creates tools to help with scientific outreach, and engages with the community.

**Purpose**: This survey aims to identify the challenges faced by reserachers and others in the research space, identify training interests, attitudes, concerns, and the most useful aspects of our activities, as well as understand our impact on participants. We will use the results to improve our resources and apply for funding to continue our work. We will share our findings in scientific papers to help others.

**Partcipation**: The survey will likely take you **~ 5-9 min** to complete. You must be 18 or older to partcipate.

**Consent**: By taking this survey, you agree to be part of our study. Your participation is completely voluntary -- you can stop anytime and skip questions. Any answers you have filled in will be automatically submitted if you close the browser window.

**Benefits and Risks**: By taking this survey, you help us to identify challenges in bioinformatics research and find effective training methods to enhance researchers' capacity and job satisfaction. The risk is low, as we won't ask for identifying information. By participating, you accept the risks of sharing information online.

**Data sharing**: We may share insights from this survey in reports or manuscripts. All survey responses will be reported anonymously. We won't ask for identifying information, and if participants share it voluntarily, we will remove it before sharing.

**Data confidentiality**: Data will be stored on a private, password-protected <a href="https://supabase.com" target="_blank">supabase database</a> with access restricted to members of the ITN Team. Any responses with volunteered identifiable information will be de-identified before being shared.

Questions can be directed to <a href="mailto:cwright2@fredhutch.org" target="_blank">cwright2@fredhutch.org</a>

## Impact of ITN resources on those to whom you recommended them

In this section, we'll ask about your experience and the impact of recommending ITN resources, though you yourself have not directly interacted with ITN resources.
